Notes for the ISD developers
============================

To compile source code obtained from the Github repository, you need
some GNU development utilities: aclocal, autoheader, automake,
autoconf 2.65 (at least) and libtoolize. As some files like
"configure" are not part of the repository, you first need to run
"autoreconf -i". Then you can run "configure" in the usual way.

All contributed code should be checked with cpplint.py.
